  Outputs logs for specific ETL9 Events.

  It works by scanning the log entries (including errors
  and information) and looking for a log entry that
  is tagged with a specified event.

  For example, you can use `StagePausedOnError` on to
  execute something (perhaps an email to an administrator)
  if a stage is paused due to an error.
